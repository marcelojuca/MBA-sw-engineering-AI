# Claude Sub-Agents

This repository contains specialized Claude Code sub-agents designed to assist with software development tasks. These agents provide focused expertise in specific areas, helping developers maintain and modernize their codebases efficiently.

## Available Agents

### 1. Dependency Auditor

**File:** `.claude/agents/dependency-auditor.md`

The Dependency Auditor is a senior software engineer specialist focused on analyzing and auditing the health, security, and status of project dependencies. This agent provides comprehensive dependency analysis without modifying any code.

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes all package managers (npm, pip, go mod, Maven, Cargo, etc.)
- Identifies outdated, deprecated, and legacy dependencies
- Performs security vulnerability scanning using CVE databases
- Provides risk assessment categorized by severity levels
- Generates detailed reports with actionable recommendations
- Analyzes the 10 most critical files affected by risky dependencies

**Use Cases:**
- Pre-release dependency health checks
- Security vulnerability assessments
- Identifying modernization opportunities
- Dependency maintenance planning

**Output:** Structured reports including executive summary, dependency inventory, risk analysis, and action plans.

### 2. Dependency Modernizer

**File:** `.claude/agents/dependency-modernizer.md`

The Dependency Modernizer is a specialist in executing safe dependency updates based on audit reports. This agent works in tandem with the Dependency Auditor to create and execute structured modernization plans.

**Key Features:**
- Creates detailed modernization plans based on dependency audit reports
- Executes safe dependency updates across multiple ecosystems
- Implements risk-based update ordering (security first, then low-risk, then high-risk)
- Provides migration paths for deprecated packages
- Includes comprehensive testing strategies
- Maintains version control best practices

**Workflow:**
1. **Analysis Phase:** Reviews audit reports and creates detailed update plans
2. **Execution Phase:** Only proceeds after explicit user approval
3. **Safety Protocols:** Uses version control, incremental updates, and thorough testing

**Requirements:**
- Must have a dependency audit report (generated by Dependency Auditor or provided)
- Requires explicit user approval before making any changes
- Creates new branches for dependency updates
- Commits changes incrementally with descriptive messages

**Output:** Modernization plans, execution reports, and updated project dependencies with full documentation.

## How to Use

### Agent Execution in Claude Code CLI

To maximize the chance of the correct agent being invoked, you must **explicitly mention the agent name** in your request when using Claude Code CLI.

#### Dependency Auditor
```
Please use the dependency-auditor agent to analyze my project's dependencies for security vulnerabilities and outdated packages.
```

#### Dependency Modernizer
For the Dependency Modernizer, you must **provide the audit report** to initiate the modernization process:
```
Please use the dependency-modernizer agent to modernize my project dependencies based on the report in docs/dependency-audit-report.md
```

### Workflow

1. **For Dependency Analysis:** Use the Dependency Auditor to get a comprehensive view of your project's dependency health
2. **For Dependency Updates:** Use the Dependency Modernizer with an existing audit report to safely update your dependencies
3. **Combined Workflow:** Run Dependency Auditor first, then use its report with Dependency Modernizer for a complete dependency management solution

### Important Notes

- Always explicitly mention the agent name (dependency-auditor or dependency-modernizer) in your requests
- The Dependency Modernizer requires an existing audit report to function properly
- If no report is available, the Dependency Modernizer will delegate the initial analysis to the Dependency Auditor

These agents work together to provide a complete dependency management solution, ensuring your projects stay secure, up-to-date, and maintainable while minimizing the risk of breaking changes.
